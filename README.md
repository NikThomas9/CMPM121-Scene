# CMPM121-Scene
 
## Scene Description

My scene is a sunken city with surreal elements. I wanted to highlight the possibility of a culture lost to time, and I used a mix of traditional and industrial elements to accomplish this. I used shrines and moai statues to represent tradition, and highway roads and broken buildings to convey industry. The main character in my scene is an alien scuba dude that has found their way to the bottom of a lost civilization to explore and collect hisorical records and artifacts.

My project was strongly inspired by 2 visual aesthetics that I am drawn to in games. The first is the undersea landscape. My references for this section were Infinite Azure from Tekken 7, the underwater stage from Super Monkey Ball 2, and Sekiro's Fountainhead Palace. The second aspect I wanted to highlight was surrealist and weird use of simple objects. My inspirations for this were Katamari Damacy, Splatoon's story mode, and plenty of early 2000s GameCube/PS2 era games that used simple, low-poly objects in scarce amounts to create surreal scenes.
